        <p>Affiliate Program Operating Agreement This Affiliate Program Operating Agreement (the "Agreement")
            is made and entered into by and between ClickConvoy ("ClickConvoy" or "we"), and you,
            ("you" or "Affiliate") the party submitting an application to become a ClickConvoy
            affiliate). The terms and conditions contained in this Agreement apply to your participation with
            https://ClickConvoy.affise.com/ ("Affiliate Program"). Each Affiliate Program offer (an
            "Offer") may be for any offering by ClickConvoy or a third party (each such third party a
            "Client") and may link to a specific website for that particular Offer ("Program Web
            Site"). Furthermore, each Offer may have additional terms and conditions on pages within the Affiliate
            Program and are incorporated as part of this Agreement. By submitting an application or participating in an
            Offer, you expressly consent to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.<br>
            1. Enrollment in the Affiliate Program<br>
            You must submit an Affiliate Program application from our website. You must accurately complete the
            application to become an affiliate (and provide us with future updates) and not use any aliases or other
            means to mask your true identity or contact information. After we review your application, we will notify
            you of your acceptanceor rejection to the Affiliate Program, generally within two (2) business days. We may
            accept or reject your application at our sole discretion for any reason.<br>
            2. Obligations of the Parties<br>
            Subject to our acceptance of you as an affiliate and your continued compliance with the terms and conditions
            of this Agreement, ClickConvoy agrees as follows:<br>
            1. We will make available to you via the Affiliate Program graphic and textual links to the Program Web Site
            and/or other creative materials (collectively, the "Links") which you may display on websites
            owned or controlled by you, in emails sent by you and clearly identified as coming from you and in online
            advertisements (collectively, "Media"). The Links will serve to identify you as a member of our
            Affiliate Program and will establish a link from your media to the Program Web Site.<br>
            2. We will pay the Affiliate for each Qualified Action (the "Commission"). A"Qualified
            Action" means an individual person who (i) accesses the Program Web Site via the Link, where the Link
            is the last link to the Program Website, (ii) is not a computer-generated user, such as a robot, spider,
            computer script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent method to appear like an individual, real live
            person, (iii) is not using pre-populated fields (iv)completes all of the information required for such
            action within the time period allowed by ClickConvoy and (v) is not later determined by ClickConvoy to be
            fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate.<br>
            3. We will pay you any Commissions earned monthly, provided that your account is currently greater than $.
            Accounts with a balance of less than$ will roll over to the next month and will continue to roll over
            monthly until $ is reached. We reserve the right to charge back to your account any previously paid
            Qualified Actions that are later determined to have not met the requirements to be a Qualified Action.<br>
            4. Payment for Commissions is dependent upon Clients providing such funds to ClickConvoy, and therefore, you
            agree that ClickConvoy shall only be liable to you for Commissions to the extent that ClickConvoy has
            received such funds from the Clients. You hereby release ClickConvoy from any claim for Commissions if
            ClickConvoy has not received such funds from the Clients.<br>
            5. ClickConvoy shall automatically generate an invoice on behalf of Affiliate for all Commissions payable
            under this Agreement and shall remit payment to Affiliate based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and
            determinations of Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by ClickConvoy at its sole discretion. If
            Affiliate disputes in good faith any portion of an invoice, Affiliate must submit that dispute to
            ClickConvoy in writing and sufficient detail within thirty (30) days of the date on the invoice. If
            Affiliate does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it irrevocably waives
            any claims based upon that invoice. If Affiliate is also tracking Qualified Actions and Affiliate claims a
            discrepancy, Affiliate must provide ClickConvoy with Affiliate's reports within three (3) days after the
            30th day of the calendar month, and if ClickConvoy's and Affiliate's reported statistics vary by more than
            10% and ClickConvoy reasonably determines that Affiliate has used generally accepted industry methods to
            track Qualified Actions, then ClickConvoy and Affiliate agree to make a good faith effort to arrive at a
            reconciliation. If the parties are unable to arrive at a reconciliation, then ClickConvoy's numbers shall
            govern.<br>
            6. If Affiliate has an outstanding balance due to ClickConvoy under this Agreement or any other agreement
            between the Affiliate and ClickConvoy, whether or not related to the Affiliate Program, Affiliate agrees
            that ClickConvoy may offset any such amounts due to ClickConvoy from amounts payable to Affiliate under this
            Agreement.<br>
            Affiliate also agrees to:<br>
            7. Have sole responsibility for the development, operation, and maintenance of, and all content on or linked
            to, your Media.<br>

            profanity or otherwise contains materials that ClickConvoy informs you that it considers objectionable
            (collectively, "Objectionable Content").<br>
            9. Not make any representations, warranties, or other statements concerning ClickConvoy or Client or any of
            their respective products or services, except as expressly authorized herein.<br>
            10. Make sure that your Media does not copy or resemble the look and feel of the Program Web Site or create
            the impression that your Media is endorsed by ClickConvoy or Clients or a part of the Program Web Site,
            without prior written permission from us.<br>
            11. Comply with all (i) obligations, requirements, and restrictions under this Agreement and (ii) laws,
            rules, and regulations as they relate to your business, your Media, or your use of the Links.<br>
            12. Comply with the terms, conditions, guidelines, and policies of any third-party services used by

            personally identifiable information, a privacy policy in compliance with all applicable laws that clearly
            and thoroughly discloses all information collection, use, and sharing practices, including providing for the
            collection of such personally identifiable information in connection with the Affiliate Program and the
            provision of such personally identifiable information to ClickConvoy and Clients for use as intended
            byClickConvoy and Clients.<br>
            14. Always prominently post and make available to end-users any terms and conditions in connection with the

            15. Make sure to not place ClickConvoy ads on any online auction platform (i.e. eBay, Amazon, etc).<br>
            The following additional program-specific terms shall apply to any promotional programs set forth below:<br>
            16. Email Campaigns. For all email campaigns, the Affiliate must download the "Suppression List"
            from the Offers section of ClickConvoy. Affiliate shall filter its email list by removing any entries
            appearing on the Suppression List and will only send emails to the remaining addresses on its email list.
            ClickConvoy will provide an opt-out method in all Links, however, if any opt-out requests come directly to
            Affiliate, Affiliate shall immediately forward them to ClickConvoy at pankaj@ClickConvoy.com Affiliate's
            emails containing the Links may not include any content other than the Links, except as required by
            applicable law.<br>
            1. Affiliate agrees that failure to download the Suppression List and remove all emails from the database
            before mailing may result in Commission withholdings, removal or suspension from all or part of the
            affiliate program, possible legal action, and any other rights or remedies available to ClickConvoy under
            this Agreement or otherwise. Affiliate further agrees that it will not mail or market to any suppression
            files generated through the ClickConvoy network and that doing so may result in commission withholdings,
            removal or suspension from the affiliate program, possible legal action, and any other rights or remedies
            available to ClickConvoy under this Agreement or otherwise.<br>
            17. Advertising Campaigns. No Links can appear to be associated with or be positioned on chat rooms or
            bulletin boards unless otherwise agreed on by ClickConvoy in writing. Any pop-ups/under-used for the

            in Affiliate's Network(each a "Third Party Affiliate"). Affiliate agrees that it will expressly
            forbid any Third Party Affiliate to modify the Links in any way. Affiliate agrees to maintain its Network
            according to the highest industry standards. Affiliate shall not permit any party to be a Third Party
            Affiliate whose website or business model involves content containing Objectionable Content. All third-party
            Affiliates must be in good standing with Affiliate. Affiliate must confirm that all Third Party Affiliates

            Network upon written notice from ClickConvoy. Unless ClickConvoy has been provided with all truthful and
            complete contact information for a Third Party Affiliate and such Third Party Affiliate has affirmatively
            accepted this Agreement as recorded by ClickConvoy, Affiliate shall remain liable for all acts or omissions
            of any Third Party Affiliate.<br>
